  Change the below url according to the docker container IP address ``` https://localhost:9443/samlsso {code} For an example, my docker container IP is 172.17.0.2 . So I have changed the url as below {code} https://172.17.0.2:9443/samlsso ```

2. **identity.xml** file located in /repository/conf/identity
  Change the below url according to the docker container IP address ``` https://localhost:9443/samlsso ```
